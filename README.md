# Colina-2ECEA-PA2(Experiment2 Numerical Python)

## Objectives
1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library 
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a 
Numpy library 

## Problem 1: Normalization
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in 
data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the 
mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation.It can be expressed as
